            <h3>My Role:</h3>
            <p>
                Since I joined the Ming Media team, I've been the sole Gameplay Programmer for Horse Valley.
                Meaning I've been responsible for essentially all code that has gone into our many updates, for example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduction of Pets</li>
                    <li>Cross Country Racing</li>
                    <li>Dynamic Breeding</li>
                    <li>Allowed support for new horse models</li>
                    <li>Unicorn Academy Collaboration Event</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                An essential part of my role has also been communicating with our incredible Game Artist and Game Designer to help shape upcoming updates.

            <!--
                Like what challenges did I have to overcome, what have I learned

                first professional experience
                roblox engine + lua
                mulitplayer
                new unfamiliar code base
                clear & frequent communication is vital
                QA testing brings a whole new prespective of features
            -->
            <p>
                Horse Valley is my first professional experience in the games industry. I've had to overcome different challenges, but I've learned and grown a lot on the way.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I first started, there were multiple challenges ahead. Learning the Roblox engine, understanding a completely new code base and I had little multiplayer experience.
                However, with my dedication to learning and with the support of my colleagues, I quickly started to understand how everything worked together. Before I knew it, I could expand existing features,
                implement new ones and answer questions regarding them.
                <br>
                <br>
                I've learned a lot about working in a professional environment as well. For example that clear and frequent communication is key.
                QA testing has also proved important and it has shown me that developers and players often view features differently. Where what may seems obvious to developers might not be to players, and
                understanding the player's perspective is vital.

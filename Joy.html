            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>
                Joy is a 3D platformer where the goal is to traverse a course as fast as possible while collecting bolts.
                It was developed by me and four other students at Blekinge Institute of Technology during a 6 week period.
                <br>
                <br>
                Joy uses its own custom built engine which runs on C++ and DirectX 11.
                It also has its own binary fileformat (.JOY) which is able to store mesh data, object data and more.

            <h3>My Role:</h3>
            <p>
                My main responsibilities in the development of Joy was mainly engine and rendering.
                Meaning I played a large part in setting up the core structure of Joy which would allow my friends to get started on gameplay.
                
                <br>
                <br>
                The follow are some more specifics behind my contributions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Engine structure</li>
                    <li>Rendering (including instanced rendering)</li>
                    <li>Glow</li>
                    <li>Light maps</li>
                    <li>Converting <b>.</b>FBX to <b>.</b>JOY</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                An essential part of my role has also been communicating with our incredible Game Artist and Game Designer to help shape upcoming updates.

            <h3>Challenges & Experiences:</h3>
            <!--
                Like what challenges did I have to overcome, what have I learned

                light maps
                instanced rendering
                converting .fbx to .joy using Autodesk api thing
                first encounter with scrum and sprints
                creating an engine that needs to be understood by others and easy to use.
            -->
            <p>
                During the development of Joy my main challenges were primarly focused around the engine and rendering techniques.
                I had never properly implemented light maps or instanced rendering before, but I understood the main principles and wanted to give both a proper try in a real project.
                Both taught me a lot about rendering, limitations of the techniques and what should be considered before implementing, it was also fun to see a performance boost from the techniques.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since Joy used its own binary fileformat, we were challenged with understanding how binary data is written and saved to disk.
                While it was difficult at first, as soon as I had grasped the core ideas it became a lot easier to work with, and the challenge had become fun.
                <br>
                <br>
                Joy was my first encounter with scrum and sprints. We were tasked with creating a product backlog, sprint backlog, user stories, tasks and their estimations.
                Estimating tasks quickly proved quite difficult, and it was common for me to give a too low estimate.
                However, the more tasks we wrote and completed, the better our estimates were, and it became fun to realise you estimated perfectly.

            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>
               Presumed Dead is a rouge-like dungeon crawler set inside a mysterious forest, where you can play alone or with up to three friends.
               <br>
               <br>
               Players must fight off different monsters while exploring the area to try and find a portal which advances them to the next level.
               Along their journey they're able to obtain passive upgrades and active items to aid them in battle.
               <br>
               <br>
               Presumed Dead was developed together with seven other students at Blekinge Institute of Technology using our own custom built engine in C++, Vulkan and ENTT.

            <h3>My Role:</h3>
            <p>
                During this almost four months long project I took on a Gameplay Programmer / Technical Artist role, where I had responsibilities in both the engine and the game itself.
                Some of my responsibilities and contributions are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Procedurally generating the environment</li>
                    <li>Handling the dungeon rooms</li>
                    <li>3D Audio and music streaming using OpenAL</li>
                    <li>Animation slots & blending</li>
                    <li>Creating a slime monster model</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                A part of my role was to also apply the agile methodology Scrum, where I would help define user stories, write tasks and estimate their time frame.

            <h3>Challenges & Experiences:</h3>
            <!--
                Like what challenges did I have to overcome, what have I learned

                first ever procedural generation
                how music streaming works
                wrapping OpenAL to fit our engine and structure
                Came up with a way of supporting animation slots
                animation blending
            -->
            <p>
                During the development of Presumed Dead I learned a lot and had the opporitunity to explore multiple different areas.
                It was my first time procedurally generating an environment which had to meet certain criteria. 
                The map had to ensure enough space to freely move around in, enemies of varying sizes required enough room to spawn in, 
                and was it essential that all areas of the world were accessible.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also got to explore how OpenAL works and how it could be incoperated into our project to fit our specific engine design and its needs.
                The two main challenges was supporting music streaming, and allowing any entity to play any sound while
                still respecting a limited amount of audio sources due to performance requirements.
                <br>
                <br>
                Anther challenge we were faced with was creating support for playing different animations on different parts of a skeleton.
                After some discussions around some ideas, I came up with a simple way of tying each bone in a skeleton to a 'slot', and to easily define slots using bone names.
                Allowing us to play an animation on a specified slot, or the whole skeleton.
